    <h1>Comparison of Tennis and Running Shoe Traction on Different Surfaces</h1>
    <p>January 2023 - April 2023</p>
    <p>Pairs were tasked with an open-ended research project on a material of our choosing. We then had to conduct serveral objective, scientific experiments of our design to determine, and then produce a scientific report of that material's characteristics and properties.</p>

    <h2>Chosen Project</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this experiment was to see if there are athletic shoe designs that are more effective for traction on varying surfaces or if the designs that are currently being used by athletes are indeed the best suited. Two types of shoes, the New Balance Fresh Foam X running shoe and the Asics Gel-Dedicate 7 tennis shoe, were each tested on a track surface and a tennis court surface with two different normal forces to obtain frictional force data. Since running and tennis shoes are designed with different movements and surfaces in mind, they have different types of traction, which means their friction forces should be unequal. By collecting frictional forces and normal forces, friction angles could be derived and used as a basis of comparison to see variations in the traction of the shoe sole and the surfaces. 
    </p>
    <p><b>It was hypothesized that tennis and running shoes are both designed to be most effective for their sport which would be supported by larger friction angles of each shoe on their own surface.</b></p>

    <h2>Overview of Experimentation and Methods</h2>
    <p>
     <h3>Expermential Data Collection:</h3>
        <p>Before the start of any trial, the weight of the running and tennis shoe were taken on a scale  and recorded. Then, clay, shaped roughly into a model foot so that weight is distributed to the front of the shoe as well as the back, was placed in the shoes. More clay was added to the shoes' opening, simulating the placement of the rest of the body weight, so that the composite weight totaled what was needed for our first, and then second desired normal forces. Once loaded, the shoes were placed in a tray of Play-Doh. After 20 seconds, the shoes and their additional weights were removed from the tray and the indentions left behind were measured using a digital caliper with millimeter measurements. Shapes with known area formulas—for example, rectangles, triangles, parallelograms, and trapezoids—were used to approximate small sections and were summed up to give a total area. This represented the contact area of the shoes and the ground when under a normal force. This gave a total of 4 different surface areas calculated and recorded.</p>
        <p>Since finding these surface areas required a series of shape estimations to be made, most errors in this experiment will most likely be from this step. Therefore, these measurements were taken with a consistent tool so any error was uniform across both shoes and each normal force.</p>
        <p>The two surfaces that both shoes were tested on were an outdoor, concrete-based tennis court and an indoor, flat rubber surface track. Three trials of each shoe on each surface were completed with each normal load, totaling 24 overall tests.</p>
        <p>Before the trials, surfaces were dried and cleared of  dirt to reduce the number of variables. For each individual trial, a shoe was placed on a surface with one of the previously measured amounts of clay so that the coinciding normal forces were achieved. A 50 N spring balance was then hooked to the shoe at the toe cap and pulled with increasing strength until the shoe started moving. Once this occurred, the shoe was displaced for an additional five seconds so that the spring balance exhibited dynamic friction and not static friction. This applied force was recorded after every trial.</p>
     <h3>Evaluation of Data:</h3>
        <p>Due to cohesion be negligible, a simplified version of the Mohr-Coulomb equation was used obtain the friction angle which can then be used to compare the different shoe and normal force combinations. A larger friction angle shows that there is greater traction while a smaller angle means less. By normalizing the normal force and frictional force by contact area, the friction angle can be compared more directly without other varying components involved.</p>

    <h2>Overview of Results</h2>
    <p>
    It was found that the running shoes on the tennis court had the most friction, with a friction angle of 36 degrees. On the track, the running shoes had a friction angle of 34 degrees. Then, with the smallest angle sizes, the tennis shoes had friction angles of 27 degrees and 28 degrees on the track and tennis court respectively. These results went against the initial hypothesis.
