                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello, World! My name is <b>Danielle Williams</b>, but I go by <b>Ellie</b>!</p>
                    <p>I am currently pursuing a combined Chemical Engineering and Computer Science Bachelor's Degrees along with minors in Civil Engineering and Creative Coding from Northeastern University (Expected Graduation Date: May, 2027).</p>
                    <p>I have diverse experiences including machine learning, energy markets, environmental compliance, academic research, and dynamic team leadership. Proficient in Python, Java, SQL, MATLAB, AutoCAD, and more, I combine engineering acumen with computational skills whenever I approach a new challenge and opportunity. I am also MS Office Specialist certified in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.</p>
                    <p>One of the privileges of attending Northeastern University is access to an immersive experiential "Co-op" program which allows students to gain positional experience working full time for a semester. I have worked in two impactful roles so far, one in 2024 and another in 2025. <h3>I am currently searching for my third and final co-op position for Spring 2026!</h3></p>

                    Being a student-athlete is not without its challenges. Like many things, there are good days and bad days.
                    I had to learn to separate myself as a competitor and myself as a person, student, and friend.
                    I couldn’t let a bad practice in the morning affect me once I stepped outside the gym; I had to roll my shoulders back and go take an exam within the next hour.
                    I couldn’t let a bad travel weekend affect me past that last point; I had to sit on that bus, put my headphones on, and catch up on the lectures I missed.
                    Being involved in two intensive, time-consuming obligations trained me to balance anything thrown my way.
                    Nothing has taught me as much as the life skills the last three years in this program have.
